      <p>
        A Full stacks Developer, with a specialization in the backend. For me, the story of humans is a story of ideas, ergo, a healthy disregard for the impossible and a need for exploration is a must. </p>

      <p>I am currently pursuing a major in Computer Information Systems with a concetration in Cybersecurity at Zicklin School of Business, to advance my academic interest and endeavors. I ultimately want to take the risk, and succeed in starting up my own tech company in the progressive future. Collectively, I am reinforcing my practical programming skills through Columbia University's Full Stack Program.</p>

      <p>I am also obsessed with self-improvement. I truely believe growth is an endlessly iterative process. I am constantly acknowledging my own ignorance and the constant doubt in my own beliefs in order to not only learn more but learn ethically right. A simple maxim I wake up to is: What should I learn today?</p>
